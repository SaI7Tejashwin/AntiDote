# The AntiDote
Antidote is a 3D-Zombie Survival Genre FPS(First Person Shooter) Game developed by a Team of 7 using Unreal Engine as the game engine for our University Course Project.

The following git project consists of the prototype developed for the final build which wasn't included due to the Git LFS constraints for large file commits.

The project developement involved coding using Visual Scripts (called as Blueprints in Unreal) as well as C++ to implement the game logic.

Some of the features developed/crafted in the final build include:
 * Player Controller Implementation (With Animations)
 * Weapon Implementation
 * Enemy AI Implementation (With Ragdoll Death Physics)
 * HUD for game stats
 * UI for various pages (Main Menu, Pause Menu, Settings Page)
